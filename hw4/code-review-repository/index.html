          <p>
            The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant
            gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing
            the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of
            the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an
            "owl-like" appearance.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant
          gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the
          ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the
          head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like"
          appearance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit,
          Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Depending on
          registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland
          Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.
          <br />
          <br />
          All Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia (OCD), a
          developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development
          throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed
          and studies point to all Fold cats being affected by it. Fold cats
          therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe
          painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. Due to these
          health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several
          countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat
          breed.

            <p>
              The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who
              was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in
              1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her
              resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born
              with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a
              neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier.

              with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a
              neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed
              with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United
              Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with
              the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding programme produced
              76 kittens in the first three years - 42 with folded ears and 34
              with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear
              mutation is due to a simple dominant gene.
              <br />
              Susie's only reproducing offspring was a female Fold named Snooks
              who was also white; a second kitten was neutered shortly after
              birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie was killed by a
              car. All Scottish Fold cats share a common ancestry to Susie.

            <p>
              The breed was not accepted for showing in Europe and the GCCF
              withdrew registrations in 1971 due to crippling deformity of the
              limbs and tail in some cats and concerns about genetic
              difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and
              deafness.

              difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and

              continued to be established using crosses with British Shorthairs
              and American Shorthairs. Since the initial concerns were brought,
              the Fold breed has not had the mite and infection problems, though
              wax buildup in the ears may be greater than in other cats. The
              concerns about deformities may have been caused by
              osteochondrodysplasia, which causes abnormalities in bone and
              cartilage throughout the body.

            <p>
              Scottish Fold kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as
              Scottish Straights. The original cats had only one fold in their
              ears, but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the
              fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to lie
              totally flat against the head.

            <h2>Body</h2>
            <p>
              The Scottish Fold is a medium to large sized cat, which can come
              in any colour, even calico. Males typically weigh 4-6 kg (8.8-13.2
              lb), and females weigh 2.7-4 kg (6.0-8.8 lb). The Fold's entire
              body structure, especially the head and face, is generally
              rounded, and the eyes large and round. The nose is short with a
              gentle curve, and the cat's body is well-rounded with a padded
              look and medium-to-short legs. The head is domed at the top, and
              the neck very short. The broadly-spaced eyes give the Scottish
              Fold a "sweet expression". The Scottish Fold's ears are folded
              hence the name "Scottish Fold".

              have nearly any coat colour or combination of colours (including
              white). Shorthair Scottish Folds have thick and soft fur, with
              longhair Folds having longer and exceptionally dense fur around
              their upper thighs, toes, ears, and tail.

              typically good-natured and placid and adjust to other animals
              within a household extremely well. They tend to become very
              attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite
              affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness,
              grooming and intelligence. Scottish Folds like to be outdoors and
              enjoy outdoor games and activities. Loneliness is something they
              heavily dislike.

              Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds
              typically have soft voices and display a complex repertoire of
              meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds. Folds are also
              known for sitting with their legs stretched out and their paws on
              their belly. This position is called the "Buddha Position".
