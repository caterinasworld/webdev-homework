          My name is Caterina and I will be teaching CS 463/563: Intro to Web
          Development this quarter. Let's get started with the first homework
          assignment. The first thing we'll do is figure out how to run code
          checks for accessibility, formatting, and valid HTML and CSS code.

          The Engineering Building is a concrete and glass, five-story building
          located on SW 4th Avenue just south of the Fourth Avenue Building and
          City of Portland Development Tower. The basement of the Engineering
          Building pre-dates its construction and is actually part of the Fourth
          Avenue Building. Designed by the architectural firm, Zimmer Gunsul
          Frasca, the Engineering Building was completed in early 2006.
